<h1>Aidrian's Top 3 Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>Well according to my personal taste LOL</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>Well, for me this one of the top tier movies of all time. I remember watching this on cinema when I was 19 years old. It is 4am in the morning and we actually wake up early just to watch this. SUPER WORTH IT!.</p>
<p>
    According to Michael, ""When God chose your kind as the object of His love, I was the first in all of heaven to bow down before you." <br />
    This is one of the best line in the movie!

<h3>Legion</h3>
<p>One of the gold movies probably. It is about a bible story where angels come to Earth to eliminate humanity. But angel Michael is there for us to defend the mandkind. Thriller and inspiring. Very good movie.</p>

<h3>Home Alone</h3>
<p>Greatest christmas movie of all time. Kevin who has left by his family home alone when they go to vacation. I love how he defend himself against the intruders. I believe this is one of the best family movie and I'll definitely watch this with my children. </p>
